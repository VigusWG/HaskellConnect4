# HaskellConnect4
## Connect 4 Search created in Haskell using MiniMax

First.hs was me giving up quite early on after trying to do everything with bit operations.
Second.hs (renamed connect4.hs) uses tuples n lists and is probably gonna be stupidly slow (im writing this whilst procrastinating finishing it)

Works for 2 step puzzles, and 3 step (it just takes a while)
Need to implement Alpha and Beta pruning

If you wanna play with it load it in and do `play board` there are a few test boards and you can add your own if you want.

Didn't get a better interface with user input cause im dumb.
