# HaskellConnect4
## Connect 4 Search created in Haskell using MiniMax

First.hs was me giving up quite early on after trying to do everything with bit operations.
Second.hs (renamed connect4.hs) uses tuples n lists and is probably gonna be stupidly slow (im writing this whilst procrastinating finishing it)

Works for puzzles up to 4 steps. Could probably do 5 but it would take a some time. 6 would be way to long
I think ive completly implement Alpha and Beta pruning

If you wanna play with it load it in and do `play board` there are a few test boards and you can add your own if you want.
Didn't get a better interface with user input cause im dumb. But if you compile it you can play against it. Or in prelude load the main file and call `main`.

ps ik the code is disgusting i wasnt thinking as I was coding I was jus solving every lil problem as it came. jus wanted to practice a few things id learnt.
